# Expert System: 
## Introduction and Basic Concepts: 
An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) technology designed to emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert in a specific domain or field of expertise. It is a computer program that leverages knowledge, heuristics, and inference mechanisms to provide expert-level advice or solutions to complex problems.

### Characteristic:
- **High Performance**.
- **Understandable**
- **Reliable**.
- **Highly Responsible.**
### Component:
- **User Interface**:
	- With the help of a user interface, the expert system interacts with the user, takes queries as an input in a readable format, and passes it to the inference engine. After getting the response from the inference engine, it displays the output to the user. In other words, `it is an interface that helps a non-expert user to communicate with the expert system to find a solution`.
- **Inference Engine**:
	- The inference engine is the reasoning component of the expert system. It applies the knowledge stored in the knowledge base to solve problems, make decisions, and provide recommendations. The inference engine uses various inference mechanisms, such as `forward chaining`, `backward chaining`, and logical reasoning, to derive conclusions from the available knowledge.
- **Knowledge Base**:
	- This is the central repository of information that the system uses to make decisions. It can include facts, rules, and learned knowledge. The knowledge base is typically structured in a way that allows for efficient querying and updating.
